#  Bitcoin Sentiment and Trader Performance Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **Bitcoin market sentiment** (Fear/Greed) and **trader performance**, using two datasets:
- A **Bitcoin Market Sentiment** dataset with daily sentiment scores.
- A **Historical Trader Dataset** with detailed trading records.

---

##  Objective

To investigate how market sentiment influences trader behavior and profitability. Specifically:
- Does the market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) correlate with average trader profits (Closed PnL)?
- Are there statistically significant differences in trader outcomes across sentiment classes?
- How do traders behave (Buy/Sell) under different sentiment conditions?

##  Datasets Used

### 1. `fear_greed_index.csv`
| Column        | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `timestamp`   | Unix timestamp                        |
| `value`       | Sentiment score (0â€“100)               |
| `classification` | Sentiment label (Fear, Greed, etc.) |

### 2. `historical_data.csv`
| Column             | Description                            |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Timestamp IST`    | Date and time of trade (IST timezone)  |
| `Closed PnL`       | Profit or loss for a closed position   |
| `Side`             | BUY or SELL                            |
| `...`              | Additional trade metadata              |

##  Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted timestamps to standard datetime format.
   - Extracted `Date` from both datasets.
   - Merged both datasets on `Date`.

2. **Visualization**
   - Trend of sentiment score over time.
   - Average Closed PnL by sentiment class.
   - Scatterplot showing correlation between sentiment score and average daily PnL.
   - Countplot showing Buy/Sell distribution under different sentiment classes.

3. **Statistical Testing**
   - Pearson correlation to quantify relationship between sentiment and profit.
   - ANOVA test to assess if PnL significantly differs across sentiment groups.

##  Key Insights

- Certain sentiment classes (e.g., "Greed") may be associated with higher or lower average profits.
- Correlation analysis shows how strongly sentiment scores align with profit trends.
- ANOVA tests determine whether these differences are statistically significant.
- Trader behavior (buying/selling) tends to vary under different market sentiments.
